Speciation is a critical process for both evolutionary science and machine learning. It helps us understand the development of life on Earth and can improve genetic algorithms' ability to find global maximums. In recent years, there has been considerable effort to understand this elusive process and uncover new techniques to simulate it. While there are many approaches for doing so, few examine one of the most important features of any genetic system: inheritance. This paper seeks to address this descrepancy and demonstrate how minor changes to a population's inheritnace mechanism can radically alter a it's ability to speciate. Specifically, we look at how meiotic inheritance and complete dominance significantly improve a population's divergent capability, even in absance of other speciation pressures.
